## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
The Frontend for my interactive Blogpost to polish my skills in FullStack development that I totally didn't copy from Reddit. The backend is available <a href="https://github.com/sudobarre/blogpost-backend">here</a>. To see the app live, visit https://sudobarre.github.io/blogpost/
This app is built using Angular 15. It uses Angular Material UI for nearly everything, and Bootstrap. Users can sign up, log in with their HTTP-Only JWT cookie, and refresh their session via HTTP interceptors. Users can create forums, post on forums and comment on posts, as well as upvote/downvote them.
I'm more than open to receive comments and constructive criticism on anything regarding the project. Feel free to contact me :)
